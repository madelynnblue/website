[fittin.gs](https://github.com/madelynnblue/fittin.gs/) was an [EVE Online](https://www.eveonline.com/) fit searcher.

It's a game where you build spaceships by fitting equipment to them, so we use the word fit or fitting when building a ship.
Then you try to blow other spaceships up without blowing up yours.
It's really hard when you start to know how to fit your spaceship.
There's a [site](https://zkillboard.com/) that lists most blowups in the game. While you *can* use it to try to figure out fits, that site isn't quite geared toward that purpose, so searching it can be slow.
I made a site that scrapes it and puts the data into a more searchable and digestable format.

It's been shut down because I don't play anymore.
